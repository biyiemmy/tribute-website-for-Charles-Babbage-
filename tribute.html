      <h3>Major Milestones Acheived By Charles Babbage Life</h3>
      <p>
        Charles Babbage led a life of invention and intellectual innovation.
        Major milestones in his life are listed below:
      </p>
      <div>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>1791:</strong> Charles Babbage is born in England on
            December 26th
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>1798:</b> Sent to Alphington near the city of Exeter for
            schooling and to recover from a fever that was nearly fatal
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1810:</strong> The already self-taught mathematician attends
            Cambridge. Due to his extensive background in math, he was
            disappointed by the instruction available at the university
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1812:</strong> Babbage, along with John Hershel and George
            Peacock, form the Analytical Society, a group that promoted the
            Leibnizian notation for differentiation in calculus
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1814:</strong> The scholar graduates without honors for
            defending a thesis that was considered blasphemous at the time
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>1815:</b> Babbage lectures at the Royal Institution on astronomy
          </li>
          <li><b>1816:</b> Made a fellow of the Royal Society</li>
          <li>
            <strong>1822:</strong> Work begins on the Difference Engine, a
            mechanized machine capable of solving polynomial functions. It used
            four basic functions: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and
            division
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1825:</strong> Babbage works with John Hershel to publish
            Aragoâ€™s rotations
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1831:</strong> The difference engine is left unfinished due
            to funding problems. While it was never completed by Babbage, two
            fully functional models were constructed in 2002
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1838:</strong> Babbage invents the pilot, the metal device
            on the front of trains that is meant to clear the track of obstacles
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1840-1871:</strong> Babbage invents the Analytical Engine.
            It marked the transition from mechanical arithmetic to full-blown
            computation. It had memory, a processor, and it could be programmed
            with small punch cards. Like the Difference Engine, this machine was
            never built. However, the Analytical Engine is considered to be the
            first conception of the modern computer
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1871:</strong> Charles Babbage dies in his home at the age
            of 79
          </li>
        </ul>
